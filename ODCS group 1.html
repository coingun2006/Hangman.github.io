</p>

<h2><u>Objective of the game hangman.</u></h2>
<p>In a set amount of tries, the object of Hangman is to guess a secret word by recommending letters. The player's probability of losing the game increases with each wrong guess; this is commonly symbolized by a stick figure being "hanged."</p>

<h2><u>Rules of the game?</u></h2>

<p><u style="color: crimson;">Configuration:</u><br><br> A single player pens down a string of blank spaces for each letter in a word or phrase that comes to mind.One letter at a time, the other player makes guesses in an effort to guess the word.
</p>
<p><u style="color: crimson;">Playing the game:<br></u></p>

<p>The letter is revealed in the relevant blank space(s) for every accurate guess.<br><br>
    A portion of the hangman figure (usually the head, body, arms, and legs) is drawn for every wrong guess.
    </p>

<p><u style="color: crimson;">Gaining and Losing:</u></p>

<p>When the guessing player correctly guesses the word before the hangman is completely drawn, they win.<br>

    If the hangman is finished before the word is guessed, the player who came up with the word wins.
